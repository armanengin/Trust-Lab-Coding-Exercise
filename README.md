* I could use tf-idf with cosine similarity which would work better for understanding the topic of the text rather than looking for just words in the text but due to time limitations I will be trying regex search instead. I would like to add that one of my Instructors has given assignment fur due this evening, therefore, I could just allocate approximately 3 hours to this assignment. The problem is he emailed us yesterday, therefore, I could not inform you.

* I traversed the given txt file by using regex expression. Whenever see the words "covid" and "economy" in whenever places of the file. Then the field marked as related to the Covid19 and its economic impact, therefore the URL count is incremented.(In the end number of files related the topic is returned). I am checking 2000 files in a month.
